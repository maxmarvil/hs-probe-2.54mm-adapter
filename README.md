# hs-probe 2.54mm adapter

This is just a test, this adapter was never made nor tested with hs-probe. Make and use at your own risk!

It should be easy to make with a PCB mill, then it can be soldered to a hs-probe castellated edge, finally a suitable 2.54mm connector should be soldered. If you make it and test it, please, report on your success or failure! Any suggestion is welcome!
